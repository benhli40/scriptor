## 🧠 Why It Exists

Most writing apps either:
- Track your keystrokes
- Force you into a subscription
- Or weigh you down with features you never asked for

**Scriptor is different.**  
It's a writing tool made for *you*, not for algorithms. It's small, sleek, and focused.

You write. It listens. That’s it.
